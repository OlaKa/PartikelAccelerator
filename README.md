**Graphical Particel Accelerator made in C++ with open source SDL graphics engine.**

On Linux download libsdl2-dev, the *.h files will be installed in "/usr/include/SDL2". In Projects settings and C/C++ Build -> Settings ->GCC C++ Compiler -> include, add the path to your *h files- In GCC C++ linker -> libraries add "SDL2" to "Libraries". And you are good to go. 

You can install this on Windows also with minGW and Eclipse, although this is really cumbersome an i would advise against it. But if you have spare time you can do it. On MAC it works without faults.
